            DTHML stands for Dynamic HTML, which is completely different from HTML.Only few selected browsers support it.
            According to the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C):
            "Dynamic HTML is a term used by some vendors to describe the combination of HTML, style sheets and scripts that allows documents to be animated."
            It is a combination of HTML,CSS,JS,DOM(Document Object Model-when DOM is constructed an individual node or an object is made for every single element).
            DHTML allows different scripting languages in a web page to change their variables, which enhance the effects, 
            looks and many others functions after the whole page have been fully loaded or under a view process, or otherwise static HTML pages on the same.
            DHTML is used to create interactive and animated web pages that are generated in real-time, also known as dynamic web pages so that when such a page is accessed,
             the code within the page is analyzed on the web server and the resulting HTML is sent to the clientâ€™s web browser.
